## The Selection Sort Visualiser

For this program, I wrote code that sorts arrays in a selection style.
This means that the program choses the lowest number and puts it in the array at place [0].
Then, it takes the next lowest number and puts it in place [1], and so on, until the array is completely sorted.

This program visualy displays this sorting method by printing out the array, moving one number, printing the array, then drawing a line between the number's old and new spots.
My program does this for the entire array.

This process is repeated for 4 different arrays, 1 in each quarter of the canvas.

## Recursive Art

The recursive art program uses the idea of recursion by calling a function multiple times and changing what happens slightly each time.
For my program, I draw 4 circles, each with circles inside that get progressively smaller.
This pattern is then drawn again over top of the top left circle in the previous drawing.
This is then repeated until the circles are of a certain size.
